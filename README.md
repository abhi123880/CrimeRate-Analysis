🔍 Crime Rate Prediction & Analysis System
📌 Overview:
Developed a machine learning-based solution to predict and visualize crime trends using real-world datasets. The project focuses on enhancing public safety insights through data-driven forecasting and interactive visualization.

🧠 Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict crime categories or potential crime occurrences based on location, time, and historical data.

Model Evaluation: Fine-tuned hyperparameters (like k value, distance metrics) using cross-validation for optimal prediction accuracy.

🧹 Data Preprocessing & Analysis
Cleaned and normalized crime datasets (missing values, outliers, date-time parsing).

Feature engineering for attributes such as:

Crime type

Location (latitude/longitude)

Time of occurrence (hour, day, month)

Detected temporal and spatial trends using statistical analysis (mean, variance, frequency distribution).

Key Features:

Real-time filtering (crime type, year, location)

Prediction form to estimate potential crime likelihood based on input parameters

✅ Impact & Use Case
Enables law enforcement and citizens to identify crime-prone areas.

Supports urban planning and public safety initiatives by revealing hidden patterns in crime data.
